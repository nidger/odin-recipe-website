# odin-recipe-website
This is the first exercise from The Odin Project.
It consisted of a homepage & 3 x recipe pages.
It was the first time using Git / Command Line / Git Hub / HTML
I found the HMTL page creation process relatively simple.
However I struggled with using Command Line Git and Git Hub for the first time.
Moving files and folders with Command Line was tricky and I think this led to some file structure issues, which resulted in some issues when trying to link the pages and the images together.
I also suspect that I could make my Git Add / Git Commit workflow a bit more efficient.
To review, I think I have a reasonable high-level understanding of the roles and functions each piece of software performs, but I have a lot of learning to do in respect of using the correct commands, learning the correct and most efficient syntax, etc
Overall, I found it trickier than I was expecting it to be.
